## Setup

1. Create a new [Notion Integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and copy the secret code which you'll use as `NOTION_API_TOKEN` in Step 4.

2. Duplicate this [template](https://ravsamhq.notion.site/Feeder-fa2aa54827fa42c2af1eb25c7a45a408) to your Notion workspace.

3. Once the template is available on your Notion Workspace, open the **Reader** database. Click *Share > Invite* and search the Notion integration you created in Step 1 and Click **Invite**. Do the same for the **Feeds** database.

4. Fork this GitHub repository and once forking is complete, go to your forked GitHub repository.

5. Enable the GitHub Actions by visiting the **Actions** tab and click "I understand my workflows, enable them".

6. Click on the **Get Feed** action in the left panel and then click "Enable workflow".

7. Go to *Settings > Secrets*. Add the following three secrets along with their values as **Repository secrets**.
   ```
   NOTION_API_TOKEN
   NOTION_READER_DATABASE_ID
   NOTION_FEEDS_DATABASE_ID
   ```
    > To find your database id, visit your database on Notion. You'll get a URL like this: https://www.notion.so/{workspace_name}/{database_id}?v={view_id}. For example, if your URL looks like this: https://www.notion.so/abc/xyz?v=123, then `xyz` is your database ID.

8. Delete the [release workflow file](.github/workflows/release.yml) as it is only required in the original repository.

That's it. Now every day, your feed will be updated at 12:30 UTC. You can change the time at which the script runs from [here](.github/workflows/main.yml#L5).
